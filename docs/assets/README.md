# Documentation Assets

Binary assets are intentionally not committed in this environment.

To add screenshots locally:
1. Run the UI: `cd ui && npm install && cp .env.example .env.local && npm run dev`
2. Capture images for:
   - `screenshot-home.png`
   - `screenshot-feature.png`
3. Place them in this folder and keep the README links the same.
